# About
An industry project collaboration with data scientists, UI/UX designers, and software engineers of the 2023 BrainStation cohort,Â  to develop a React App point of sale concept. 
The app incorporates Lush Lens technology and Lush sustainability initiatives. I focused on the navigation bar, login page, and wrote a Python web scraper to gather data on Lush Products.
