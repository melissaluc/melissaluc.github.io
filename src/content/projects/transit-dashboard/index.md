# About
This project leverages open-source data to create a full-stack web application that provides a comprehensive dashboard summarizing the performance of transit routes.
Users can select a specific corridor or transit route/line to access detailed statistics and visualizations.
The dashboard offers key metrics and charts, including headway, on-time performance (OTP), speed profiles, and more.

It empowers users to investigate potential service impacts and make data-driven decisions for transit optimization
